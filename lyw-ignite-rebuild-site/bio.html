LIYW has always been able to keep their motivation and passion simple, making positive, truth-filled music and building up anyone who comes in their path.<br><br> In 2002, the band recorded their self-released EP "All These Things Tie Me Down", followed by their debut full length "The Sun Rises and the Sun Sets, and Still Our Time is Endless." Since that time, the band has lived on the road, building friendships and doing their best to change the world, one song and one relationship at a time.<br><br> Joshua Kellam, LIYW vocalist states, "For all of this we credit and thank Jesus Christ: for talents and blessings we never once deserved. So, know that everything we do and everything that drives us goes back to and is because of God. We will never be perfect men, and we will never do everything right, but we are doing what we can to love and cherish people the way they were meant be treated. Life in Your Way does not come to the show with any hidden agendas. We come to share, respect and grow friendships with anyone and everyone. Hardcore was once based on the idea that we could all learn from each other, but we need to first admit that we don't know everything. It's clear that we all have a lot to learn in this life. Before we are a band we want to be people who are ready to listen and reason with anyone."<br><br>Now in 2005, Life in Your Way is in an amazing place. California-based Floodgate Records will release the bandâs latest project "Ignite and Rebuild" into the Christian market on October 11th, partnering with Valdosta, GAâs Indianola Records. The band will spend the fall on the road, touring the west coast, and then heading to Europe ö a dream of the young band.<br><br>Josh continues, "We pray that our songs might be an encouragement and even bring growth for people today. Thereâs a lot of weight on the shoulders of the young. Our music is written to inspire with truth and love."<br>           </td>          </tr>         </table>         <!--END CONTENT--></layer></ilayer></td>  <td>   <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">    <tr>     <td><script language="JavaScript1.2" src="scroll2.js"></script><img src="images/scroll.jpg" border="0" usemap="#scroll" width="79"></td>    </tr>   </table>  </td> </tr></table></body></html>
