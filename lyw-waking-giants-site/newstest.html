<span class="mainContent">IMPORTANT!! We have been hard at work getting ready to get back out playing shows, and things are going really well. Unfortunately, James Allen is no
longer a part of Life In Your Way. It's sad to see him go, but he felt it
was his time. James has been a key part of this band since he joined 3.5
years ago, and we wish him the best. Catch him and Dave on tour right now
with <a href="http://www.playradioplay.com" target=_blank>Play Radio Play</a>!! Dave plays guitar and james is managing this tour for those guys! We miss them.<br><br>

We are excited to anounce that Corey Stroffolino formerly of The Risk Taken has joined Life In Your Way!! Both Corey and Todd have been doing a great job so far, and we can't wait to get back on the road and introduce the world to this new line up!!<br><br>

We have a lot of exciting things in store, and are so thankful that we can
keep doing this. Please stick with us!!</span><br><br><br>

<span class="mainContent"><a href="images/julynews.jpg" target=_blank><img src="images/julynews.jpg" border="0" width="290"></a><br>Thanks to everyone who came out this past tour and all the people we got to hang out with at C-stone. It was a blast.<br><br>

One important thing for us about this past tour was that it was Dave's last in the band. Dave has been with us for 3 years and recorded 2 albums in the band. He was a key member and will be missed dearly. Thanks to him for all his passion and hard work.<br><br>

His re-placement will be a founding member of LIYW returning to the band, Todd Mackey. Todd is coming back after 4 years, He is simply the right person for the position. So, be excited!<br><br>

We have a few festivals lined up and should be getting <a href="tour.html" target="frames">tour dates</a> up shortly for Late August or September. Be on the lookout for those.<br><br>

Thanks from LIYW</span><br><br><br>

<span class="mainContent"><a href="images/maynews.jpg" target=_blank><img src="images/maynews.jpg" border="0" width="290"></a><br>Thanks to everyone who came out for the "In Your Face Tour". It was a blast. So many great <a href="tours.html" target="frames">shows</a> and even greater kids.<br><br>
We've got some shows coming up with August Burns Red, along with their CD
release show on June 22nd. Come on out have some fun with us!</span>
