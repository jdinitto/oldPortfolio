However, since that time, Sparkle Blue has gone through various member 	changes, which has made it tough for Sparkle Blue to recieve a strong following 	until recently. It wasn't until early 2002 that God brought Casey to Josh (drums), 	and Ryan (bass) to complete the newly-found, talented, and totally committed trio.<BR><BR> Sparkle Blue will have their first album, "Two Heart Summer" ready for the consumer, and other music guru's in early February 2003. The songs on this album reflect Sparkle Blue's music from 1995 through Mid-2002.<BR><BR>  "I felt I needed to get all of the music I have written out there before releasing our newest material," stated Casey. "If we just released all of our newer stuff, I would feel like a piece of Sparkle Blue's history would be missing."<BR><BR>  The focus of Sparkle Blue's lyrics have remained consistent over the years. "What I think weare trying to do is write catchy pop songs that deal with everyday life, while at the sametime glorifying our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." states Ryan.<BR><BR> Sparkle Blue has played shows with such bands as <A HREF="http://www.acetroubleshooter.com"target=_blank>Ace Troubleshooter</a> (<A HREF="http://www.toothandnail.com" target=_blank>Tooth and Nail Records</a>),<A HREF="http://www.shop11phoenix.com" target=_blank>Shop 11 Phoenix</a> (<A HREF="http://www.bettierocket.com" target=_blank>Bettie Rocket Records</a>), <A HREF="http://www.deadpoetic.com" target=_blank> Dead Poetic</a> (<A HREF="http://www.solidstaterecords.com" target=_blank>Solid State</a>),  <A HREF="http://www.huntingtonsusa.com" target=_blank>The Huntingtons</a>, and <A HREF="http://www.farewelltofashion.com" target=_blank>  FarewellTo Fashion</a> (<A HREF="http://www.fdrecords.com" target=_blank>Future Destination Records</a>). SB's resume also includes a successful week long tour with <A HREF="http://www.sidewalkslam.com" target=_blank>Side Walk Slam</a>  (<A HREF="http://www.toothandnail.com" target=_blank>Tooth and Nail</a>) and   <A HREF="http://www.7-10split.org" target=_blank>7-10 Split</a> (Sept. 2002.).<BR><BR> SB's future will continue to bring the rock, which includes shows with <A HREF="http://www.hangnailmusic.com"target=_blank>Hangnail</a>, <A HREF="http://www.huntingtonsusa.com" target=_blank>The Huntingtons</a>, and a part in many Christian festivals in the summer of 2003.<BR><BR> Sparkle Blue will also be releasing a 7" record (2 songs only appearing on the 7"), and a 6 song CDEP, both yet to be named, in Spring, 2003.		</body>	</html>
